WDB is a database system for storage and retrieval of weather and 
water observations and forecasts. It handles both gridded data
(raster) and point data.

wdb-stationplacesync:
    Loads weather stations meta-data (location, validity time ...) into the WDB database. 
    The original data is read from STINFOSYS database. 
    The wdb-stationplacesync operates straightforward: reads the records from STINFOSYS and inserts them into WDB. 
    This way the stations history should be preserved in WDB as well. 
    The WDB is expected to handle the meta-data properly and consitently. 
    The STINFOSYS is expected to provide correct data.


To compile and run app make sure you have wdb libraries.
Please check that WDB version supports wci functions like:
    wci.addplacepoint
    wci.addorupdateplacepoint

The configure line might look like:
    ./configure wdbload_CFLAGS=-I<local-dir>/include LDFLAGS=-L<local-dir>/lib wdbload_LIBS=-lwdbLoad

STINFOSYS (see: http://stinfosys/) will be used as authoritative source for weather stations meta-data.

When building debian packages it is importan to have proper setup.
This mean that all wdb dependenciea are in place. If wdb has been
installed then include and library paths will point to it.


USAGE
       wdb-stationplacesync can be called with all options present on the command line (check --help or man pages).
       It is more convenient to use main configuration file to set the values:

       wdb-stationplacesync --config /etc/stationload.conf

       Finer logging can be turned on to see the data that is to be inserted into WDB:

       wdb-stationplacesync --config /etc/stationload.conf --loglevel 1

       Main config file looks like:

           cns-namespace=88000
           wmo-namespace=88001

           # WDB database connection parameters
           database =     # database name
           host =         # host name
           port =         # port
           user =         # user name

           # STINFOSYS database connection parameters
           stdatabase =   # database name
           sthost =       # host name
           stuser =       # user name
           stport =       # port
           stpass =       # password
