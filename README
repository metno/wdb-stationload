WDB is a database system for storage and retrieval of weather and 
water observations and forecasts. It handles both gridded data
(raster) and point data.

stationLoad:
    is a loading program used to load met.no weather stations information into wdb.


To compile and run app make sure you have wdb libraries.
Please check that WDB version supports wci functions like:
    wci.addplacepoint
    wci.addorupdateplacepoint

The configure line might look like:
    ./configure wdbload_CFLAGS=-I<local-dir>/include LDFLAGS=-L<local-dir>/lib wdbload_LIBS=-lwdbLoad

STINFOSYS (see: http://stinfosys/) will be used as authoritative source for weather stations meta-data.

When building debian packages it is importan to have proper setup.
This mean that all wdb dependenciea are in place. If wdb has been
installed then include and library paths will point to it.
However if that is not the case use environment varibales to set up:
export LIBRARY_PATH=<some_local_path>/lib
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=<some_local_path>/include/
export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=<some_local_path>/include/
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<some_local_path>/lib
export wdbload_CFLAGS=-I<some_local_path>/include
export wdbload_LIBS=-lwdbLoad
